	<h1>You Can Be Fired for Being Overweight. Should New York Change That?</h1>
	<h2>The City Council is expected to approve a bill this spring that would ban weight discrimination in hiring and housing.</h2>
	<p><b>By Emma G. Fitzsimmons</b></p>
	<p>Victoria Abraham has attracted a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fatfabfeminist/"target="_blank"> huge online following</a> as a self-described fat activist who preaches body positivity and calls out bias. But after graduating from New York University last year with a degree in public policy, she cannot avoid wondering if her job search will be hampered by her size.<br>
	Ms. Abraham makes no secret of her weight, including her body in the photo on her LinkedIn profile so prospective employers know whom they are considering hiring.<br>
	“There is a perception that you’re lazy or unable to do the work,” she said. “People don’t even realize that they have that bias.”<br>
	Ms. Abraham was among a group of people who testified recently on behalf of a bill that would prohibit discrimination in New York City based on a person’s weight or height in employment, housing and access to public accommodations. Although the bill has not been scheduled for a vote, it has the support of a majority of the City Council, with 34 co-sponsors out of 51 members, and could be approved as soon as May.</p>

	<p>Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/14/us/politics/eric-adams-wellness-vegan.html"target="_blank">published a book in 2020</a> about losing 35 pounds on a plant-based diet, said on Wednesday that he was supportive of the bill and was still reviewing the details.<br>
	“We should never treat people differently because of their weight,” Mr. Adams said at a news conference at City Hall.<br>
	The effort is part of a growing national campaign to address weight discrimination, with <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/lawmaker-wants-to-make-discrimination-against-weight-height-illegal/"target="_blank">lawmakers in New Jersey</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2701f7a890e7a8adcae1b0e0eefcc1d1" target="_blank">Massachusetts</a> considering similar measures banning the practice. Michigan and Washington State already prohibit it, as do some cities, like Madison, Wis., and Washington, D.C.<br>
	The momentum to add weight to the list of protected groups, which now includes race, gender, religion and disability, comes as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/style/body-positive-instagram.html" target="_blank">body acceptance movement continues to gain popularity.</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/arts/podcasts-diets-healthy-living.html" target="_blank">Podcasts like “Maintenance Phase” </a>and <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-fat-creators-are-revolutionizing-what-i-eat-in-a-day-videos" target="_blank">social media creators</a> have spread awareness that <a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/health-and-wellness-articles/can-you-be-overweight-and-healthy" target="_blank">not all overweight people are unhealthy</a>, and that health metrics like the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/healthy-bmi-obesity-race-/2021/05/04/655390f0-ad0d-11eb-acd3-24b44a57093a_story.html" target="_blank"> body mass index are flawed</a>.</p>
